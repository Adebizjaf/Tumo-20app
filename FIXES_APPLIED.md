# Comprehensive Website Fixes - October 30, 2025

## ✅ All Issues Fixed

### 1. Translation API Rate Limiting (FIXED ✓)

**Problem:**
- LibreTranslate API was hitting rate limits (403/429 errors)
- Multiple failed endpoints flooding console
- Translations failing frequently

**Solution:**
- ✅ **MyMemory API is now PRIMARY** - More reliable, higher rate limits, free
- ✅ LibreTranslate endpoints used as fallback only
- ✅ Quick skip for rate-limited endpoints (403/429)
- ✅ Removed duplicate API call code
- ✅ Better error logging with emojis

**Result:** Translations now work reliably with minimal console noise

### 2. Request Abort Errors (FIXED ✓)

**Problem:**
- "request aborted" errors showing in overlay

- Node.js throwing unhandled errors

**Solution:**
- ✅ Added middleware to catch aborted requests gracefully
- ✅ Global error handler for ECONNRESET errors
- ✅ Proper error handling in body parsers
- ✅ Silent handling of abort errors in translation routes

**Result:** No more annoying error overlays when navigating

### 3. Speech Recognition & Microphone (FIXED ✓)

**Problem:**
- "Speech recognition service not allowed" errors
- Microphone not working in conversation mode
- Race conditions in permission requests

**Solution:**
- ✅ Added secure context check (HTTPS/localhost requirement)
- ✅ Removed redundant permission check causing race condition
- ✅ Enhanced all error messages with detailed troubleshooting
- ✅ Added comprehensive logging for debugging
- ✅ Browser compatibility checks

**Result:** Speech recognition works reliably on localhost/HTTPS
