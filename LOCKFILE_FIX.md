# Netlify Deployment - Lockfile Fix

## ✅ Issue Resolved

### Error Message:
```
ERR_PNPM_OUTDATED_LOCKFILE  Cannot install with "frozen-lockfile" 
because pnpm-lock.yaml is not up to date with package.json
```

### Root Cause:
When we added `cors` to the dependencies in `package.json`, the `pnpm-lock.yaml` file wasn't updated. Netlify's CI environment uses `--frozen-lockfile` by default, which requires the lockfile to match the package.json exactly.

### Fix Applied:
1. ✅ Ran `pnpm install` to update the lockfile
2. ✅ Committed `pnpm-lock.yaml` with the cors dependency
3. ✅ Pushed to GitHub

### Changes Committed:
- Updated `pnpm-lock.yaml` to include `cors@2.8.5` in dependencies

## 🚀 Next Steps

Netlify will automatically detect the new commit and start a new deployment. The build should now succeed!

### Monitor Your Deployment:
1. Go to your Netlify dashboard
2. Check the latest deploy
3. Watch the build logs

### Expected Build Output:
```
✅ Installing npm packages using pnpm version 10.14.0
✅ npm run build:client
✅ cd netlify/functions && npm install
✅ Functions deployed successfully
```

## Testing After Deployment

Once deployed, test these endpoints:

```bash
# Test ping
curl https://your-site.netlify.app/api/ping

# Test translation
curl -X POST https://your-site.netlify.app/api/translation/translate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text":"hello","source":"en","target":"es"}'
```

## Summary of All Fixes

1. ✅ Fixed translation API with multiple fallbacks
2. ✅ Enhanced offline dictionary (6 languages, 30+ phrases each)
3. ✅ Fixed cors dependency location
4. ✅ Created Netlify functions package.json
5. ✅ Updated Vite config to serve root files
6. ✅ **Updated pnpm-lock.yaml** ← This fix!

Your app should now deploy successfully to Netlify! 🎉
