## 🔍 Technical Details

### Safari Detection
```typescript
// Reliably detects Safari on any platform
isSafari()        // Desktop + iOS Safari
isIOSSafari()     // iOS only
isMacSafari()     // macOS only
```

### Permission Flow
```typescript
// Explicitly requests microphone before speech recognition
requestSafariMicrophonePermission()
  → Calls getUserMedia() for audio
  → Triggers iOS/macOS permission dialog
  → Returns success/failure
  → Provides specific error messages
```

### Error Handling
```typescript
// Maps 9 error types to user-friendly messages
handleSafariSpeechError(error)
  → "service-not-allowed" → Safari-specific fix
  → "not-allowed" → Permission denied
  → "audio-capture" → Microphone issue
  → ... 6 more error types
```
