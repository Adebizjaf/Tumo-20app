## Console Diagnostic Commands

If you're comfortable with JavaScript, paste these in browser console:

### Check Safari Detection
```javascript
// Safari detection test
const ua = navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase();
const isSafari = /safari/.test(ua) && !/chrome|chromium|crios/.test(ua);
const isIOSSafari = /iphone|ipad|ipod/.test(ua) && /safari/.test(ua);
console.log('🔍 Browser Check:');
console.log('  isSafari:', isSafari);
console.log('  isIOSSafari:', isIOSSafari);
console.log('  Full UA:', ua);
```

### Check API Availability
```javascript
// API availability test
const SpeechRecognition = window.SpeechRecognition || window.webkitSpeechRecognition;
console.log('🔍 API Check:');
console.log('  SpeechRecognition available:', !!SpeechRecognition);
console.log('  isSecureContext:', window.isSecureContext);
console.log('  mediaDevices available:', !!navigator.mediaDevices);
console.log('  getUserMedia available:', !!navigator.mediaDevices?.getUserMedia);
```

### Check Microphone Permissions
```javascript
// Permissions check
if (navigator.permissions) {
  navigator.permissions.query({ name: 'microphone' }).then(perm => {
    console.log('🔍 Microphone Permission:');
    console.log('  State:', perm.state); // granted, denied, or prompt
  });
}
```
