## Debugging Failed Tests

### If "service-not-allowed" Still Appears

**Check:**
1. URL is HTTPS (not HTTP)
2. Not in private/incognito mode
3. Microphone is connected and working
4. Safari version is 14+ (check Safari â†’ About Safari)
5. Console shows Safari detection logs

**Console Commands:**
```javascript
// Check Safari detection
navigator.userAgent.includes('Safari')

// Check secure context
window.isSecureContext

// Check speech API
window.SpeechRecognition || window.webkitSpeechRecognition

// Check microphone
navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ audio: true })
```

### If Permission Dialog Doesn't Appear

**On macOS:**
1. System Preferences â†’ Security & Privacy â†’ Microphone
2. Ensure Safari is checked
3. Restart Safari

**On iOS:**
1. Settings â†’ Safari â†’ Microphone
2. Change to "Ask" or "Allow"
3. Force quit Safari (swipe up from app switcher)
4. Reopen Safari

### If Translation Doesn't Work

**Check:**
1. Network connection is active
2. Console shows translation requests
3. Try text input (should work)
4. Check server logs if available
