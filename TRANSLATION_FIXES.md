# Translation Fixes Applied

## Problems Identified
1. **502 Bad Gateway Error**: The LibreTranslate public API at `https://libretranslate.de` was returning HTML error pages instead of JSON responses
2. **Missing CORS Dependency**: The `cors` package was in devDependencies instead of dependencies
3. **Limited Offline Fallback**: The offline dictionary had very few phrases

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling
- Added detailed logging for API failures
- Better error messages in console for debugging
- Graceful fallback to offline mode when API fails

### 2. Multiple API Fallbacks
Updated `server/routes/translation.ts` to try multiple translation APIs:
- Primary: `https://libretranslate.com` (changed from .de to .com)
- Fallback 1: `https://translate.argosopentech.com`
- Fallback 2: `https://libretranslate.de`

The server will automatically try each endpoint in order until one succeeds.

### 3. Expanded Offline Dictionary
Added 30+ common phrases per language pair for:
- English ↔ Spanish
- English ↔ French  
- English ↔ Yoruba

Includes: greetings, common words, time expressions, basic conversation

### 4. Improved Fallback Logic
- Exact phrase matching (case-insensitive)
- Word-by-word translation for unknown phrases
- Confidence scoring based on translation coverage
- Better provider identification (offline vs offline-unavailable)

### 5. Configuration File
Created `.env.example` with documentation for:
- TRANSLATION_API_URL
- TRANSLATION_TIMEOUT_MS

## Testing the Translation

Your app is now running at: **http://localhost:8083/**

The translation system will:
1. Try the online API first (with automatic fallbacks)
2. If all APIs fail, use the enhanced offline dictionary
3. Display appropriate confidence levels and provider info

## Next Steps (Optional)

To fully resolve the API issues, you can:
1. Set up your own LibreTranslate instance
2. Use a paid translation API (Google Translate, DeepL, etc.)
3. Add more phrases to the offline dictionary
4. Implement caching to reduce API calls

## Usage

Simply type text in the app and it will automatically translate. Check the browser console for detailed logging about which translation method is being used.
